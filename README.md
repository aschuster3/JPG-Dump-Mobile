JPG-Dump-Mobile
===============

A mobile version of the great JPG Dump website (www.jpgdump.com)

---

As of June 25th, 2014, JPG Dump has ceased to exist.  With any luck, the site owner will release the source code and I'll try to work to make a simple build that will erect a local server so that, if you so choose, you could have your own personal JPG Dump, but I can't make any promises.

It was a pleasure developing this application and depending on if I get the source code, I may still complete the searching functionality and filtering just for posterity sake.  The application will be taken down from the Play Store, but I'll include a signed version in the assets folder from here on so that anyone wishing to download the app in its original form can do so.
